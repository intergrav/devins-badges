# Please do not use the badges in this folder!
## Instead, use the badges in the /assets folder.
### Why?
This is the old badges folder. I am planning on removing this folder around december. I made a new one so that the badges could be organized and with multiple versions, as I wasn't expecting this project to grow so much. Please use `/assets`.
