## ❓ About
This is Devin's Badges! A project I work on in my spare time that contains cool badges for you to use in your projects.

I aim to be as consistent as possible with these. I also try to make these look great on most modern sites.

## 📰 Using in your project!
Adding these badges to your website? Follow these steps! You can use the `svg` files instead of `png` if you would like, if you know how to use vectors.

All you really need to do is copy these depending on what file type you are using this with, replace `~category~` with whatever category you are linking to, replace `~badge~` with the badge name of whatever badge you are doing, replace `~link~` with whatever you are linking to, and replace `~alttext~` with you guessed it - alt text. 

Check out the [assets](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges/tree/v1/assets) folder to see all the badge types. I don't have a website for badge picking currently, but that might come in the future if anyone feels like making one.

#### Markdown
`[![~alttext~](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intergrav/devins-badges/v1/assets/~category~/~badge~_64h.png)](~link~)`

#### HTML
`<a href="~link~"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intergrav/devins-badges/v1/assets/~category~/~badge~_64h.png" alt="~alttext~"></a>`

Also, you don't need to add credit - it would be nice for you to do so, but I really don't care if you do or not. I just make these for fun!

### 📄 Some guidelines I recommend following
While you don't have to do this, I recommend following these guidelines to make sure the badges look great on your page!
- Don't scale the badges any bigger than 64 height or any lower than 56 height
- Don't modify the badges unless needed, instead ask me to make one
- Don't have the badges too close to other text

## ➕ Adding more badges!
Want to add your own badges to the project? Feel free to open up an issue and I'll make one! This project is made with Figma. If you are opening a PR, I will probably edit your badge just to make sure it fits in as well as possible with the rest.

## ❗ Disclaimer!
This is currently a work in progress, I only have a few badges for a few services right now. However, I am planning to have a lot more badges in the coming weeks.
